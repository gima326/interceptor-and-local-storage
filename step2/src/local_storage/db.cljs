;; -- Spec --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This is a clojure.spec specification for the value in app-db. It is like a
;; Schema. See: http://clojure.org/guides/spec
;;
;; The value in app-db should always match this spec. Only event handlers
;; can change the value in app-db so, after each event handler
;; has run, we re-check app-db for correctness (compliance with the Schema).
;;
;; How is this done? Look in events.cljs and you'll notice that all handlers
;; have an "after" interceptor which does the spec re-check.
;;
;; None of this is strictly necessary. It could be omitted. But we find it
;; good practice.

;; But the challenge stipulates to NOT load the setting for the "showing"
;; filter. Just the todos.

;; -- cofx Registrations  -----------------------------------------------------

;; Use `reg-cofx` to register a "coeffect handler" which will inject the todos
;; stored in localstore.
;;
;; To see it used, look in `events.cljs` at the event handler for `:initialize-db`.
;; That event handler has the interceptor `(inject-cofx :local-store-todos)`
;; The function registered below will be used to fulfill that request.
;;
;; We must supply a `sorted-map` but in LocalStore it is stored as a `map`.
